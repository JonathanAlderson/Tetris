# Tetris
Old sixth form Tetris project

This was make using Tkinter a while ago in Sixth Form.
I think there were some small bugs making it different to Tetris,
in the way that the tetriminos are destroyed when the lines are removed.

After making Tetris, I also had a go at making an AI for it. This 
was one of my first AI attempts, so was fun to learn for myself,
and think about the problem in a computer way.
